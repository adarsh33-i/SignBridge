# SignBridge ASL & ISL Grammar Rules

This document describes the **rule-based gloss grammar** implemented in SignBridge. Spoken text is tokenized, reordered, and mapped to uppercase gloss tokens shown on the signing chip and avatar.

**Implementation:** `lib/services/translate/sign_grammar_engine.dart`  
**ASL reference constants:** `lib/services/translate/asl_grammar_rules.dart`  
**ISL reference constants:** `lib/services/translate/isl_grammar_rules.dart`  
**Compliance tests:** `test/services/asl_spec_compliance_test.dart`, `test/services/isl_spec_compliance_test.dart`

## Pipeline (both languages)

```
SpokenTextPrep.normalize
  → strip function words (is/am/are, a/the, do/can/must, prepositions, and/or …)
  → lemmatize verbs, map pronouns
  → numerical incorporation (Rule of 9 / ISL numeral compounds)
  → language-specific reorder (_applyAslRules / _applyIslRules)
  → aspect & modality (WILL, FINISH, NOT-CAN)
  → noun–adjective swap
  → NMM markers (questions, negation, intensity)
  → SignLexiconBuilder → gloss tokens
```

| Spoken language code | Sign system |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `ENG` | ASL |
| `HI`, `TA`, `ML` | ISL |

## ASL rules

Primary framework: **Time + Topic + Comment** (Germanna / LifePrint curriculum model).

### Module 1 — Foundational structures

| Rule | Pattern | Example (English → gloss) |
|------|---------|---------------------------|
| Time first | Time adverb before topic/comment | *I went to the store yesterday* → `YESTERDAY STORE ME GO` |
| Topic–comment | Object/topic before subject + feeling verb | *I like dogs* → `DOG ME LIKE` |
| IF clauses | Condition then result | *If it rains, the game is cancelled* → `IF RAIN GAME CANCEL` |
| Simple SVO | Three-word transitive (non-pronoun) | *The boy sees a dog* → `BOY SEE DOG` |
| Pronoun wrap | Optional trailing copy of subject | *I eat an apple* → `ME EAT APPLE ME` |

**Omitted from gloss:** articles (`a`, `the`), copula (`am`, `is`, `are`), most auxiliaries, conjunction `and` (lists use body tilt / listing NMM instead).

### Module 2 — Questions, negation, rhetoric

| Rule | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| WH-final | WH-sign at end + `[wh-q]` | *Why did you go?* → `YOU GO WHY [wh-q]` |
| Y/N questions | `[y/n-q]` prefix + pronoun copy | *Are you Deaf?* → `[y/n-q] YOU DEAF YOU` |
| Post-fix negation | `NOT` / `CANNOT` + `[headshake]` | *I cannot cook* → `ME COOK CANNOT [headshake]` |
| Reason clause | keep the speaker's junction: `because` → `REASON`, `so` → `SO`, then the reason | *I am late because traffic was heavy* → `ME LATE REASON TRAFFIC HEAVY` |

### Module 3 — Word mechanics

| Rule | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Copula drop | Identity / adjective predicates | *The car is red* → `CAR RED` |
| Identity | Subject + noun | *I am a teacher* → `ME TEACHER` |

### Module 4 — Directional verbs

Agreement verbs incorporate subject/object direction:

| Example | Gloss |
|---------|-------|
| *I give you* | `ME 1-GIVE-YOU ME` |
| *You tell me* | `YOU TELL-ME YOU` |

### Module 5 — Time, numbers, aspect

| Rule | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Rule of 9 | Cardinals 1–9 fuse with time units | *3 weeks ago* → `3-WEEKS-AGO` |
| ≥10 separate | Large numbers stay separate | *12 weeks ago* → `12 WEEK PAST` |
| Age incorporation | Small cardinal + years | *I am 5 years old* → `ME 5-YEARS-OLD` |
| FINISH aspect | Past / `have` without time anchor | *I have eaten* → `ME EAT FINISH` |
| AND omitted | Conjoined nouns listed | *I like dogs and cats* → `DOG CAT ME LIKE` |

### Module 6 — Space, loci, NMM

| Rule | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Locatives | Location first, then compound | *The phone is on the table* → `TABLE PHONE-ON-TOP` |
| Spatial loci | Named referents get `IX-a`, `IX-b` | *John likes Mary* → `JOHN IX-a LIKE MARY IX-b` |
| Contextual NMM | Appended when triggered by vocabulary | `[mm]` routine, `[cha]` intense, `[th]` accidental, `[cs]` closeness |

### ASL gloss order (default clause)

When no specialized handler matches:

1. **Time** words moved to front (`today`, `yesterday`, `now`, …)
2. **Topic** (nouns / objects)
3. **Subject** pronouns (`ME`, `YOU`, `MY`, …)
4. **Comment** (verbs)
5. **WH** signs at end

Negated clauses may reorder to **Topic + Subject + NOT + Verb**.

### ASL non-manual markers (NMM)

| Marker | When |
|--------|------|
| `[y/n-q]` | Yes/no question (clause start) |
| `[wh-q]` | WH question (clause end) |
| `[rh-q]` | Rhetorical question — only for a caption that asks one. A `because`/`so` statement keeps its junction sign instead, and `so` before an adjective (*so happy*) is an intensifier, not a clause junction |
| `[headshake]` | Negation |
| `[mm]` | Habitual / routine |
| `[cha]` | Intensity (`very`, `slow`, …) |
| `[th]` | Accidental action |
| `[cs]` | Closeness / proximity |

Defined in `lib/services/translate/asl_nmm_markers.dart`.

## ISL rules

Primary framework: **Time → Subject → Object → Verb (SOV)** with topic–comment for emphasized objects.

### Core sentence order

| Rule | Pattern | Example (English → gloss) |
|------|---------|---------------------------|
| SOV default | Time → subject → object → verb | *I went to school yesterday* → `YESTERDAY ME SCHOOL GO` |
| Object–verb | Object before verb | *I eat an apple* → `ME APPLE EAT` |
| Topic–comment | Fronted topic + comment | *That book, I like it* → `BOOK THAT ME LIKE` |
| Time + work | Time before action | *Today I go to work* → `TODAY ME WORK GO` |

### Questions & negation

| Rule | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| WH on sign | WH word gets `?` suffix (no trailing `[wh-q]` in chip) | *Where are you going?* → `YOU GO WHERE?` |
| Y/N prefix | `[y/n-q]` when subject is `YOU` / demonstrative | *Are you coming?* → `[y/n-q] YOU COME?` |
| Negation after verb | `NOT` immediately after verb | *I don't know* → `ME KNOW NOT` |

### Word mechanics

| Rule | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Adjective after noun | Noun before adjective | *Big house* → `HOUSE BIG` |
| Copula drop | State predicates | *The boy is happy* → `BOY HAPPY` |
| Third person | Pointing, not `IX` | *He is happy* → `POINT-THERE HAPPY` |

Pronoun overrides for Hindi/Tamil/Malayalam in `IslGrammarRules.islPronounOverrides`.

### Spatial & compounds

| Rule | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Locative compounds | Surface + `-ON` / `-IN` / `-UNDER` | *Book on table* → `TABLE BOOK-ON` |
| Directional give | Agreement verb | *I give you water* → `ME GIVE-YOU` |

### Clauses

| Rule | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Because / reason first | Reason clause before main | *I stayed home because it rained* → `RAIN HOME ME STAY` |
| IF | Condition then result | *If rain comes, game cancelled* → `IF RAIN GAME CANCEL` |

### Numbers & age

| Rule | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Numeral incorporation | Cardinal + unit fused | *3 days* → `3-DAY` |
| Age | Dedicated pattern | *I am 25 years old* → `ME AGE 25` |

### Names

| Rule | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Name intro | `MY NAME` + fingerspelled name | *My name is Adarsha* → `MY NAME FS-ADARSHA` |
| Name question | Romanized or English | *tumara nam kya hai* → `YOUR NAME WHAT?` |

### ISL conversational polish

Applied after core reorder:

- `WANT` / `NEED` often clause-final
- `HOW-MUCH` for price/quantity questions
- `VERY` intensifier placement
- Imperatives: trailing `!` on `QUICK`, `CALL` (e.g. `AMBULANCE CALL QUICK!`)

Conversational corpus: `test/fixtures/isl_conversational_sets.txt` (300 HI/TA/ML sentences).

### ISL NMM

Same marker set as ASL except ISL WH questions use **`WHERE?`** on the sign instead of a separate `[wh-q]` token in the chip output.

Defined in `lib/services/translate/isl_nmm_markers.dart`.

## Validation & audit tests

| Test file | What it checks |
|-----------|----------------|
| `asl_spec_compliance_test.dart` | ASL Modules 1–6 examples |
| `isl_spec_compliance_test.dart` | ISL structure, spatial, time, names |
| `isl_conversational_audit_test.dart` | 300-sentence HI/TA/ML corpus (exact gloss match) |
| `isl_rules_audit_test.dart` | 18 core ISL grammar sentences |
| `category_corpus_audit_test.dart` | 100 English daily-life sentences (ASL coverage) |
| `asl_grammar_shift_audit_test.dart` | Complex English → ASL coverage |
| `caption_gloss_audit_test.dart` | Corpus-wide caption → gloss audit: meaning survival, provenance, preview drift ([report](caption_gloss_audit.md)) |

Run all grammar compliance tests:

```bash
flutter test test/services/asl_spec_compliance_test.dart \
             test/services/isl_spec_compliance_test.dart \
             test/services/isl_rules_audit_test.dart
```

## Gloss is on-device only

Every gloss the app shows comes from the rules above. There is no cloud gloss
worker, no model call, and no network request anywhere between the caption and
the avatar, so the same sentence produces the same gloss with the device in
airplane mode.

The app used to offer an optional hosted Gemini gloss worker and to prefer its
answer when the gloss mapped to a signer clip. Both were removed; `LocalGlossService`
is the only `GlossService` the locator builds.
